Ay \nNew money, suit and tie \nI can read you like a magazine \nAin't it funny? Rumors fly \nAnd I know you heard about me \nSo hey, let's be friends \nI'm dying to see how this one ends \nGrab your passport and my hand \nI can make the bad guys good for a weekend \nSo it's gonna be forever \nOr it's gonna go down in flames \nYou can tell me when it's over, mm \nIf the high was worth the pain \nGot a long list of ex-lovers \nThey'll tell you I'm insane \n'Cause you know I love the players \nAnd you love the game \n'Cause we're young, and we're reckless \nWe'll take this way too far \nIt'll leave you breathless, mm \nOr with a nasty scar \nGot a long list of ex-lovers \nThey'll tell you I'm insane \nBut I've got a blank space, baby \nAnd I'll write your name \nCherry lips, crystal skies \nI could show you incredible things \nStolen kisses, pretty lies \nYou're the King, baby, I'm your Queen \nFind out what you want \nBe that girl for a month \nWait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no \nScreaming, crying, perfect storms \nI can make all the tables turn \nRose garden filled with thorns \nKeep you second guessing like \nOh, my God, who is she? \nI get drunk on jealousy \nBut you'll come back each time you leave \n'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream \nSo it's gonna be forever \nOr it's gonna go down in flames \nYou can tell me when it's over, mm \nIf the high was worth the pain \nGot a long list of ex-lovers \nThey'll tell you I'm insane \n'Cause you know I love the players \nAnd you love the game \n'Cause we're young, and we're reckless (oh) \nWe'll take this way too far \nIt'll leave you breathless, mm (oh) \nOr with a nasty scar \nGot a long list of ex-lovers \nThey'll tell you I'm insane (insane) \nBut I've got a blank space, baby \nAnd I'll write your name \nBoys only want love if it's torture \nDon't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya \nBoys only want love if it's torture \nDon't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya \nSo it's gonna be forever \nOr it's gonna go down in flames \nYou can tell me when it's over (over) \nIf the high was worth the pain \nGot a long list of ex-lovers \nThey'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane) \n'Cause you know I love the players \nAnd you love the game \n'Cause we're young, and we're reckless \nWe'll take this way too far (ooh) \nIt'll leave you breathless, mm \nOr with a nasty scar (leave a nasty scar) \nGot a long list of ex-lovers \nThey'll tell you I'm insane \nBut I've got a blank space, baby \nAnd I'll write your name"

    "lyrics": "When routine bites hard and ambitions are low \nAnd resentment rides high but emotions won't grow \nAnd we're changing our ways, taking different roads \nThen love, love will tear us apart again \nLove, love will tear us apart again \nWhy is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side \nIs my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry \nYet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives \nBut love, love will tear us apart again \nLove, love will tear us apart again \nDo you cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed? \nThere's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold \nJust that something so good, just can't function no more \nBut love, love will tear us apart again \nLove, love will tear us apart again \nThen love, love will tear us apart again \nLove, love will tear us apart again"
